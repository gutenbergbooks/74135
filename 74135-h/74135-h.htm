BODY AND MY RETURN—<br>
AFTER MANY DAYS</h2>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Release</span></h3>

<p>It was true then: I was suddenly and finally
released from my body; “this time,” I said, or
thought: “I will not have to return.”</p>

<p>Many times, almost numberless, I had experienced
the wonderful consciousness of being absent
from my human form, of mingling with arisen
friends in their higher state of existence, but, until
this time I had always known that it was only for a
brief season and that there was a tie—a vital and
psychic tie—binding me to return to my earth form.
But <i>now; now</i>; could it be true? Was I set free
to live and work with the Beloved—the dear ones—in
this their higher, more perfect state?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>The Best Beloved, those who had preceded me
into this wondrous life, came thronging around, by
degrees, to welcome me: not all at once, but first
those who were by tenderest ties the nearest and the
dearest.</p>

<p>They did not answer my question: “Have I
really come to stay”?</p>

<p>The Guide—the Guardian, took me gently in
charge that I might not even think of the form I
had so lately left. A great sense of relief; of being
set free from the limitations of the body, filled
me, far greater than I had ever experienced before.
A feeling pervaded me that <i>all of me</i> was released.
It surely <i>seemed</i> that my work in the human body
was done: that the last word was spoken, the last
pen-stroke made.</p>

<p>O, the wonder, the unspeakable joy of thus being
united with the Beloved—those whom I knew had
never died, but had thrown off their garments of
dust for the more beautiful raiment of the spirit!</p>

<p>In a narrative written for others to read one cannot
dwell minutely on the sacred meetings with
those who were ever nearest and dearest; those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the household, related by ties of consanguinity and
those who were kindred in spirit, united to one in
thought and aspiration. All that such reunion
means, more than can be dreamed or imagined
where one is in the human state, was now my possession.</p>

<p>“Turn away, turn away from all thought of the
Earth-form;” said the one appointed to lead and
guide me in this newer, grander flight.</p>

<p>One by one—or in groups—the dear ones of the
Earth-home joined us, welcoming me ever, yet ever
evading the oft recurring question, “Am I really
here to stay?”</p>

<p>My attention was continually attracted to some
group or company that had not been seen by me—always
a surprise to find them “<i>all there</i>.” They
would smile and seem to answer, “Yes, all here,
in our own particular states, and doing our own
appointed work.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vastness of the Spirit Realm</span></h3>

<p>There was a perception of great <i>Light</i>, a consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of Illumination, an awakening to the <i>vastness</i>,
the <i>unlimitation</i> of this Realm of Spirit.</p>

<p>O how often, when in “dreams” or “visions” I
had been permitted and aided by my Guides to visit
the Spirit States, this inner and higher Realm, I had
longed to remain! But ever willing to answer the
call of duty, of added work to be performed by me,
I would return to fill my place at the appointed time.
<span class="smcap">Now; Now?</span>—</p>

<p>All else was swallowed up—eclipsed by the
wonderful experiences that came—the Beloved
Presences—the vistas of luminous Spirits! This
was a state of <i>Super</i>-Consciousness; the awakening
of faculties and perceptions before unknown, of <i>being
aware</i>, almost without limitation: of KNOWING.
Whatever <i>is</i> the nature and state of the <i>real
Ego</i> this seemed as near to the <i>Absolute</i> as one
could well conceive! There was so <i>much</i> of me!
There was so <i>little</i> of me! There were so many
and such surpassing Spirits! How one shrinks in
the presence of the mighty ones! How one expands
in the Knowledge of the Infinite: His Image!</p>

<p>Often in approaching a transcendent Light there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
would appear an atmosphere of ensphering tints—there
would also seem to be a sphere of sound, of
surpassing music. On being admitted to that sphere
it would prove to be a group of spirits who thus in
accord <i>are Light</i> and <i>Harmony</i>. Where one can
enter such an “atmosphere” communing with such
a group it is because one has <i>need</i> of and is in harmony
with the spirits of that group.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Senses Merged in Perception</span></h3>

<p>Objective scenes seemed ever to be <i>adaptations</i>
to my state, and would often vanish as I became
aware of the minds or spirits suggested by the
scenes.</p>

<p>“All human sensations, as sight and hearing, are
readily perceived by one awakening to spiritual
states to be but <i>manifestations of consciousness
through the physical limitations</i> to which the spirit
in its mental states of earth becomes accustomed.
But <i>here</i> all is merged in <i>perception</i>—where one
<i>perceives</i> and <i>understands</i>,” thus said the Guide.</p>

<p>This added consciousness—uniting or releasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the faculties—is not all at once: I found myself
thinking in the accustomed channels, in <i>words</i> as
well as thoughts, <i>listening</i> for replies instead of
knowing that the answer had been <i>thought</i> to me,
really was there before I had questioned; of <i>looking</i>
for beautiful <i>forms</i> and scenes instead of <i>perceiving</i>
the <i>Soul of Beauty</i> which was (is) everywhere.</p>

<p>I became more and more aware that the whole
of me, released from the fetters of the bodily senses,
could perceive and receive more perfectly the answer
to every question, even before its formulation
in thought.</p>

<p>“Formulation is a process of limitation, sometimes
of hindrance,” said the Guide. “A feeble comparison
of what ‘perception’ really is may be found
in an artist (of Earth) whose <i>prepared mind</i> (and
therefore vision) sees the beauty in a landscape, a
sunset sky that another sees not at all, or dimly.
Prepared senses are the result of prepared minds,
of being pervaded by the <i>awareness</i> of the Spirit,”
said the Presence.</p>

<p>It is of little avail, however, to attempt to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
into outward forms of thought and expression the
<i>perceptions</i> one is aware of while one is in that inner
state, excepting that they relate to conditions under
which those loved and loving ones in that state can
reach and change for the better the sorrowing hearts
in human life, the shadowed conditions of earth
existence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Body in Charge of Guardians</span></h3>

<p>After a time (I did not know it as <i>time</i>) I became
aware of being led to where the earthly form
was still breathing, being cared for and imbued with
breath by a beloved Guardian spirit and by devoted
friends in human life. I was to return after all! It
was necessary to keep my spirit <i>en rapport</i> with the
body as the <i>Psychic Cord</i> was <i>not</i> severed that connected
body and spirit. But not at once was I to
return.</p>

<p>These periods of calling my attention to and visiting
the body were brief—just enough to keep the
“vital spark” alive, and aid the dear attendants in
both worlds to prevent the complete separation
which for many days seemed imminent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Vast Congregation</span></h3>

<p>It is well known to those who may be interested
in reading these pages that during all the years of
my mortal life (since the age of eleven) I have
been brought before audiences and assemblies of
people—many thousands; among them were hundreds
who became friends—some of them life-long,
some of later years. I had known of the “passing
on” of very many who had been members of those
audiences and of my own “Flock,” but I was not
prepared for the <i>vast congregation</i> that came out of
their respective groups composing a still greater concourse
to meet me, nor was I prepared to realize
that I knew most of them as friends on Earth!</p>

<p>There were those who had heard the utterances
of my Guides through my lips when I was a child;
those who had attended and were my personal
friends when I was “still in my ’teens”; and those
who in later years had been of the audiences in
many places; and those of my own beloved Congregation!</p>

<p>How difficult to realize that they were all gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
into the larger “Congregation of the skies.”
Each and all unfolding, working in whatever line
of knowledge and work was theirs to attain and
achieve! And to find all the treasured jewels of
friendship more bright in the added lustre of the
larger life; the flowers in the Garden of true Affection
growing more and more transcendently fair!</p>

<p>This is indeed Heaven! Next in blessedness to
the Homes of the Best Beloved which are the very
<i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ministrations of Spirits</span></h3>

<p>It was wonderful to note the ministrations of
spirits to those in other less fortunate states—especially
to those in Earthly forms. Wherever the ties
of consanguinity were also of real affection the
spirit guardians of the household responded to the
“call,” perhaps only a thought, a longing, or a silent
prayer for aid and strength, or a <i>need</i> unknown to
the one ministered unto.</p>

<p>Time is not a factor on the spirit side, the response
to a need—an aspiration, a prayer is instantaneous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Where there seems to be delay, and often
doubt in the minds of those on Earth as to the
presence and ministration of the loved one who has
been summoned, it is because of Earthly barriers,
because those in the human state cannot perceive—and
many, alas, are not willing to receive the spirit
friend. I saw that the usual barriers are: Uncontrolled,
selfish grief—mourning for the one who has
“passed on” and often forgetting the other dear ones
of the household who are left; seeking for the communion
to forward a purely <i>selfish</i> purpose; and,
in general, the obstruction of false education, theological
and material, through which the spiritual
faculties have been closed for generations.</p>

<p>When human hands and hearts, even though the
latter is wrung by pain, seek to <i>help others</i> who are
in sorrow or need, then the way is opened and the
<i>helpers</i> are helped by the ministering ones.</p>

<p>To mourn the friend as utterly “gone” who has
only dropped the outer garments of the dust is to
close, for the time, the avenue of communication or
ministration. Long must the spirit helpers work and
wait for people to be ready to receive their response<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to the call for aid. So many did I see who could
not reach the recognition of their loved ones that I
wished <i>over</i> and <i>over</i> again <i>that there were more
real</i> “<i>Message bearers</i>,” more to give comfort to
those that mourn! And then the Presence answered:
“Not all are ready to whom the Messages
now are given, nor are those protected adequately
who are the chosen Instruments for Message bearing,
but the seed is being sown and will take root
in thousands of lives.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thought-Forms</span></h3>

<p>I was shown those who existed in the <i>thought-forms</i>
and scenes of their recent human states: Such
as these were surrounded with the “things” (forms
of things) familiar to them on Earth, and apparently
necessary to their happiness even in the new
state of existence. These scenes illustrated that our
lives even in the human state, consist largely of
“<i>states of mind</i>,” that we see the things we are accustomed
to see, or have trained our minds or wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to see omitting many and sometimes <i>most</i> of the
things of beauty and of import that we <i>might</i> see.</p>

<p>The spirit states that are “exactly like the scenes
of Earth” are composed of the thought-forms of
the spirits’ imaging or reproduction, and <i>are</i> the <i>reality</i>
to them. I recalled the weaving of a web that
I had once seen an industrious spider perfect and he
was afterward caught in his own web. I wondered
if we are not often in human life—and the states
that immediately follow the weavers of many such
“cobwebs”? These thought-webs seemed to proceed
from the minds of the spirits fashioning them
and in which the spirits seemed to be ensphered,
sometimes enshadowed. Before my questionings
had <i>taken form in my mind</i> the answer came from
the Presence: “No, they are not enmeshed <i>by</i> the
thought-forms; their creation is the result of the
present <i>condition</i>; remove the power to produce
thought-forms, <i>i.e.</i>, to create ones own environment
and you remove all activity of mind. As the Spirit
unfolds the thought-forms change and then disappear
as <i>perception</i> takes the place of limitation by
the senses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>With the almost axiomatic proposition that “our
world of life is what we make it” our spirit-surroundings
and conditions the result of our states of
unfoldment, it became less difficult even when returning
to the limitations of human organism to understand
the conditions of existence in the “next
stage” of personal experience beyond the “transition”
misnamed “death.”</p>

<p><i>Spirit states are as varied as are the personal
states of those composing them; the knowledge—or
lack of it—possessed by the person</i> <span class="allsmcap">IS</span> <i>the spirit
state</i>, i.e., <i>knowledge of spiritual principles</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, if one could coin new words, or new understandings,
in order better to express that which one
knows when set free from Earthly environment!
Yes, the <i>New Understanding</i>; that is the great
need; and that must really be <i>attained</i> by <i>unfoldment</i>,
growth from within, the pervading all illuminating
power of the spirit.</p>

<p>Those in the spirit states who were reproducing
the familiar scenes of their recent Earth conditions
were satisfied and even very happy—especially
when the scenes so reproduced were of a nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
that had brought comparative happiness in Earth
life—in their ability to make things seem “exactly as
they did in Earth life,” not even knowing that this
similitude was the result of their own thought-forms
instead of being <i>inherent</i> or <i>organic</i> in the “spirit
land.”</p>

<p>Interesting and absorbing as were these lessons
of observing, the process of weaving their thoughts
into the forms most desired or needed by the spirits
producing them, there were many whose reproductions
were of the shadowed kind and were not voluntary,
but results of the deep impress that the shadows
of Earth-experiences had made upon their
minds. No <i>one</i> illustration could serve—but all
states and conditions that I could realize were
shown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Time Not a Factor</span></h3>

<p><i>Time</i> does not seem to be a factor in the realm
of spirits except as related to people and events in
the human state with which spirits have connection.</p>

<p>It was, however, a source of continual wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and surprise to note the changing forms and <i>atmospheres</i>
in the surroundings of those with whom I was
brought in contact. I saw spirits who, when in
Earth life had been in positions of external power—usually
considered “exalted”—as of kings or rulers—the
result of no “merit” or achievement of their
own, but the “incident” or “accident” of birth, who
were arrayed in their <i>own thought-robes</i> of power,
but closer observation would reveal the poverty and
meagerness of their “Robes of Royalty” and they
were sometimes seeking somewhat with which to
clothe themselves, something to <i>conceal</i> their paucity
of raiment and surroundings. Most of those,
however, who had held such positions as are the
result of “titles,” “rank” and “castes,” seemed endowed
with perception enough to know that those
external conditions are not perpetuated in spirit
states, unless one has become so imbued with the
<i>idea</i> that “titles,” “wealth,” and outward “honors”
are <i>valuable</i> in <i>themselves</i>. And that the “Divine
Right of Kings” is indeed a “right” derived from
Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Truly Great Are Humble</span></h3>

<p>I saw many of those who had been poor in
worldly possessions, even despised and scorned
among men or put to death because of their advocacy
of an unpopular “cause” now radiant in their
own spiritual brightness, unconsciously</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wearing their sunbright thoughts</div>
<div class="verse">For Robes of Royalty.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ah! How beautiful were they! These of the
shining faces and radiant hearts! Ever intent on
trying to aid humanity, whether in shadowed spirit
states or in Earthly conditions.</p>

<p>One may not give the names (even if one knew
them) by which these in the various spirit states
were known on Earth. I saw many who were
known to be Great: Great in thoughts, deeds and
words for the enlightenment of their fellow-beings.
Ever were they humble, as ever are the truly <i>Great</i>.
None in spirit life are outwardly <i>adorned</i> with the
“honors” given to them or their “memory” by a
tardy World. The truly exalted are far too intent
on ameliorating the adverse conditions of spirit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
human states to take note of the praise and pomp of
Earthly “celebrations” in “memory” of them, sometimes
tardily bestowed.</p>

<p>To be truly Beloved by an individual, a country
or a world is indeed blessed, and exalted souls do
know and understand the true meaning of being
“appreciated and beloved.”</p>

<p>The Light of the Shining ones, the Great ones,
is not dimmed in the brightness of the higher spheres,
for they are of its light a part.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spirit Groups and Inspirers</span></h3>

<p>It is because of the spirit possessions that those of
kindred thoughts, perceptions, aspirations are attracted
to each other and form groups—not conventional
or arbitrary—interchanging ideas—purposes—and
working <i>together</i> for others. I saw
them “<i>moving upon</i>” the minds of those in Earth-forms
whom they could reach, sometimes singly,
sometimes in groups, as the conditions might require.
The Student in his library, the Inventor in his “work
shop” or laboratory, the “Discoverer” in his Observatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
searching for new worlds or on ships of
“exploration” sailing for Unknown lands, more particularly
those who are seeking to solve the vexed
“problems” of human life.</p>

<p>Ah! It was indeed a scene of wonder to see
each and every spirit thus intent on doing good to
his kind, imparting some needed thought, some
“clue” or “thread” of an intricate proposition that
would solve the whole! Long are these “Inventions”
and “discoveries” known in Spirit states before
the one is “born” into human life that can give
them outward Expression. How luminous seemed
the Atmospheres of Spirit thus surrounding those in
Earth life when the Heavenly presences were near!
And such lives are always luminous in their own
brightness or the Higher ones could not “draw
near” and inspire them.</p>

<p>The people know the names of some of those
now on Earth whose “discoveries,” “inventions,”
and works have transformed the world! Those
arisen ones who aid in bearing forward the Works
Beautiful, direct their thoughts to such as are ready
in Earth life. Here are the “Thinkers,” whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
knowledge of the Truths of the Universe constitutes
the source of all power, Ideas that born of those
Truths reach the minds prepared to receive them
and <i>move the world</i>. We saw and paused among
assemblies, groups pursuing their usual course of
conferring, interchanging of ideals and preparing to
impart more and more the knowledge that is theirs—as
minds are prepared to receive.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge is imparted by adaptation.</i></p>

<p>All such <i>imparting</i> of <i>knowledge must be by
adaptation</i>. The Spirit is attracted—would be
from the very nature of the Spirit—to the one best
prepared to receive <i>from that Spirit</i>. Thus the subtle
law of imparting knowledge by adaptation governs
the realm of spirit and constitutes the basis of
deciding concerning “Guides,” “Guardian Spirits,”
and all “ministering ones.” <i>Affection</i> determines
the intimate personal guardians.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">From Spirit to Spirit</span></h3>

<p>It was most interesting and enlightening to see—as
I was permitted to witness—a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
those who are in human states receiving from luminous
and illuminating spirits some new application
of science or art, some new presentation of
Truth! The minds of Earth so impressed are not
narrowly questioning “from whence do the ideas
come”? Fearful, if from another <i>mind</i> that those
receiving them may “lose their Individuality.”
Such minds know that Truths belong to <i>minds</i>—and
that <i>somewhere</i> are greater minds than one’s
own—who can impart knowledge. <i>Truth is the
common heritage of souls</i>; of Intelligence; and
happy is the mind, spirit or Angel that can perceive
or receive it <i>from any source</i>. Intelligence alone
perceives and imparts Intelligence.</p>

<p>The process of imparting knowledge from spirit
to spirit (whether those imparting and receiving are
in spirit states or still in Earth-forms), grows ever
more and more interesting as one passes into greater
awakening and perception of the <i>realities</i>, the <i>verities</i>
of spirit. “Teaching,” “Education” (in the
human sense) only exists in those states or conditions
in the spirit realm where the human methods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and forms of thought still govern the minds of the
spirits.</p>

<p>Love is the great Illuminator in all realms and
worlds, and thus <i>adaptation</i> of Teacher and the one
to be taught <i>must</i> be the keynote to all reception of
knowledge.</p>

<p>One would like to say so much while comparing
the “Educational” process of spirit states with the
methods of Earth (excellent as some of the latter
have become); but one must hasten to record added
experiences while they are near to the outward consciousness
from within. For when one enters again
into the daily life of Earth, even although it is ever
pervaded by those surpassing scenes, the vividness
of the higher state becomes dimmed by the necessary
veiling that human conditions bring.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">There is an Answer for Every Question</span></h3>

<p>Everything that I <i>wished to know</i> found ready
answer; even before the wish was formed into
<i>thought</i>. I could realize that the answer came from
the Guide, who was my teacher by adaptation. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
could realize that for every <i>real</i> aspiration there is
ever an answer; in fact that the answer from within
and above prompts the aspiration, the wish to know.
That there is a solution for every so-called “problem”;
for, in the final analysis, there <i>are</i> no “problems”—except
<i>states</i> of <i>non-perception</i>.</p>

<p>All this and a thousand times more of inward
awakening came to me as I grew in the perception
of the Knowledge of the Spirit.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Those Who Love Their Fellow-Beings</span>”</h3>

<p>I saw a countless multitude growing brighter,
more resplendent, as I was led nearer. Among
them were those more radiant than the others—greater,
it seemed, in the scope and power of their
spirits.</p>

<p>I recognized—not always from personal knowledge
on Earth—some of the individuals who were
there, centers of groups of radiant ones, those who,
when in Earth life “loved their fellow men”; and
who, by word and deed had sought to overcome the
errors and abuses heaped upon humanity. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
battles with tongue and pen (no armaments or
weapons of war), their shining armors of Righteousness—were
finally known and appreciated by
many minds (souls) on Earth.</p>

<p>One whom I had known from early childhood
came toward me with the group of his friends and
relatives, whom I had also known. He greeted me
as he was ever wont to do when we both were in
Earth-forms. Though advanced in years before he
left the form, he was ever youthful, ever calm and
peaceful; yet firm and forceful in his advocacy of
his convictions of Human Brotherhood, and the
final triumph of the spirit over errors of human conditions
in Time and Sense. By those who knew his
life and works he was considered a “leading and
inspiring mind”; to many he was a Prophet of the
“Good time Coming.” How my spirit thrilled with
this meeting with him and his household and the
group of friends who were with him. One question
I had often asked in mind, or had wished to know
concerning it:</p>

<p>Had he—this friend with whom I was then conversing,
met in spirit states the one who in a distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
land of Earth had said: “—— —— is the
greatest man America ever possessed”?</p>

<p>The one who said this to a prominent writer was
also a “lover of his fellow men,” but the two had
never met in Earth life. The question was not
asked; before it could be formulated the answer
came: “Yes, we have met and often confer together.
In all <i>essentials</i> relating to the <i>Supreme
Realities</i> of life and the growth of human beings
toward perfection through knowledge of Divine
Truth and Love we are in perfect accord.” I then
perceived from among that goodly company the
one approaching of whom we had been speaking;
our thought of him and our appreciation had attracted
him to us. Long and earnestly they spoke
of the things <i>to be</i> when the children of Earth shall
be set free from the shadows caused by ignorance.
I more and more perceived some of the personalities
of those illuminated ones, and more than once was
I surprised that those who had been of such widely
different conditions, environment, education, habits
of mind, and, one would think, opposite spiritual
states could be together!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>The Presence aware that the surprise would exist,
said:</p>

<p>“As you already know, differences of birth, nationality,
outward rank and even of education, are
not <i>real</i> differences in spirit. These are (and were)
all lovers of their kind—lovers of Peace through
Enlightenment and Righteousness, and they are
now, as they were when on Earth constantly seeking
through interchange of high Ideals, to find the
best means for helping others—to lift the clouds of
ignorance from the minds of earth; even now one
is within your vision whose presence here will surprise
you.” I saw a stately form and recognized
the one who, as the head of a great Ecclesiastical
organization had in the “Prayer for Peace” issued
a short time before he had passed from his Earth-form
given the following significant sentence:</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">May They (the Nations) Remove the
Causes of War.</span>”</h3>

<p>As a lover of humanity, a promoter of Peace, he
seemed to stand near these shining ones, many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
whom when on earth (and now) have never recognized
<i>any</i> Ecclesiastical Authority. Of course, I
knew that all such lines, barriers, and human standards
are removed—or rapidly vanish—in spirit
states among Enlightened minds. And that they
realize, as this one must have realized, that the
Earthly “Office” and all its outward symbols and
adornments cannot continue in a realm where the
<i>real</i> nature stands revealed—the nature of the
spirit.</p>

<p>All these composing this radiant assemblage were
intent on reaching and for their good, acting upon
the minds of those on Earth for the “Promotion of
Peace on Earth and Love to All.”</p>

<p>Alas and alas! “Those engaged in actual war—the
war raging between one-half the nations of
the Earth that call themselves ‘enlightened’ cannot
be reached until the leaders and rulers have learned
the lesson taught by bitter experience.” So the
Presence said, and so I had perceived, saddened by
the thoughts of the awful human suffering that must
ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Shadows of the Conflict</span></h3>

<p>Then I was shown the dense Shadow—the awful
darkness that seemed an engulfing abyss: the scenes
of the conflict now raging on Earth. That which I
saw (then just begun), seemed, however, more to
represent the spiritual and mental states of Rulers
and Leaders than the physical scenes of battles. I
saw the bright spots where the ministrants of mercy
were rallying, regardless of nationality or “class,”
to aid those physically wounded, to breathe a word
of comfort to those injured mortally who were
“passing on.”</p>

<p>Above the terrible scenes of battles I saw those
in the “rank and file” of the armies and navies who
were so suddenly wrenched from their bodies.
Their first thoughts (as their last thoughts had
been), were of those loved ones from whom they
were suddenly parted when ordered “to the front.”
They were aided to find the dear ones (alas where
were the “homes”? now desolate. Many of the
families scattered and in deepest suffering, great
physical want, and greater grief.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>They tried, often without avail, to comfort and
aid the dear ones, their own states of mind and
grief over the separation preventing them from effectively
ministering to their loved ones. They soon
became aware that the aid could not be material,
that spiritual strength and consolation must be from
spiritual sources and that they might, if themselves
strong in spirit, move upon the minds of others in
human life to aid those dear to them.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight to behold the ministering
spirits succoring, comforting, instructing those
thus suddenly thrust into spirit states; none but those
endowed with the Divine Gift of loving compassion—like
a Florence Nightingale or a Clara Barton—could
so successfully aid those spirits thus ruthlessly
torn from their human ties and forms. It is an awful
sight! Yet the spirit “Rescuers” are there!
The “Red Cross” of the skies finds its way to those
who need the help and guidance.</p>

<p>In a measure the Soldiers, all who must go to
war on land or sea, are better prepared for the
sudden change than those hurled into spirit life by
“accident” of shipwreck or other disaster, or by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
volcanic or earthquake shock. The Soldier <i>knows</i>
that he is to confront possible and even probable
physical death—and being thus prepared often is
less surprised and shocked when he finds himself
“out of his body.” Yet, wherever the need may be,
the “strong helpers” are there: above every scene of
human sacrifice, whether Cataclysmic, “natural
causes” or the result of human ignorance and neglect,
or the self-seeking aggression of war, there are
they—the dear ones, the strong ones, the saving
ones!</p>

<p>All cannot be aided to at once perceive the new-found
condition: everything must depend on the degree
of spiritual preparedness, which is often greater
among the humble and lowly—who have a line of
simple life, simple love, simple duty to follow than
among the more complex mental and moral states
of the “leaders.” The real state, spiritually, determines
the “condition” of the spirit in spirit life.</p>

<p>Nor were the “clouded” and “shadowed” scenes
of Earth life found alone above the lines of battle.
There were sometimes deeper shadows among the
scenes of “pleasure” and “mirth,” mocking splendor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of wealth and its opposite of want, squalor, misery,
the <i>toll of human sacrifice is not always in the
“death” of the body</i>. There are vortices more terrible
than the volcano’s fiery breath or earthquake’s
yawning mouth; the palace often seemed more
densely shadowed than the hovel; while the dwelling,
though a cottage, brightened with Love shone
out like a star of splendor.</p>

<p>“Spiritual knowledge, the unfoldment of the
highest from within, this alone can change the
‘shadowed states’ of Earth into brightness. Every
life must be reached; every mind touched and
awakened by the spirit; the ‘good’ that is within
each must be brought forth.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Turning for Respite</span></h3>

<p>From the storm-scenes of contending forces, from
the darkness of Spiritual night, from the uncertain
states, like dim twilight, one ever turns in spirit to
the Beloved, to the groups of loved and loving ones
that constitute the “Home of the Spirit.” “Spiritual
rest is change,” respite from witnessing the unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
conditions, the shadows of spiritual states
that one cannot at once remedy. “Rest” is not idleness:
communion, companionship, <i>working together
for those who can be aided</i>—this is rest. The
“Home Group” ever intent upon ministering wherever
and whenever needed, afforded the respite
sought. Such memories of Earth-experiences as
had been kept alive in the sacred altar-flame of
true affection and home ties; such interchange of
Ideals and experiences as the later years had
brought; such knowledge of the blending of the
spirit and the mortal states, the guardianship and
ministration of the loved arisen ones over those in
Earth-forms, this was rest. Blessed respite; blessed
communion; one would never be ready, it would
seem, to part with such companionship.</p>

<p>Nor <i>do</i> we ever “part” with the truly loved.
Whatever duties we must perform for those in spirit
or human states, <i>those most in accord, those nearest
and dearest are ever with us</i> “whether in or out of
the body.”</p>

<p>Our human phrases, and even our usual thoughts
seem superficial, weak and puerile when endeavoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
to describe the divine <i>realities</i> of the Spirit.
We never “part”; we can never be “absent” from
the Beloved. Yet the shadows of human existence:
“time and sense,” and outward “change” and
“circumstances” are upon those who make “the
house of clay” the limit of their mental and spiritual
possessions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reunion with Lovers of “Peace”</span></h3>

<p>Returning again and often to the bright sphere
composed of “those who love their fellow-beings”;
from among them came those whom I had known—with
whom I had, as a humble worker labored
for some cause—<i>this time</i> a few, especially two or
three last seen in Earth life at the Hague Peace
Conference (1907). “Ah, how well we then knew—as
well as even now when the conflict rages—that
the nations (44 in number) were not all, indeed
but few of them, seeking for ‘peace’; the permanent
establishment of a Court of Arbitration for
the world! Each was there to ‘test’ the others;
nearly all endeavoring to gain some concession from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the others to aid in their own selfish future aggressions”!
Such was the thought flashed from my
friend of the brilliant mind and noble heart who
came with others to greet me. And the dear lady
who took me in her arms and kissed me when we
parted there at the Hague even as she did now,
said: “We meet again, and here there is sweet
Peace—but O, the horrors of the war! And <i>you,
you will return to Earth for further work</i>.” She
gave me her blessing with such love as her grand
soul can give.</p>

<p>The other one, he of the brilliant mind and facile
pen, he of the awakened and illumined spirit, said:
“Yes, you will return to Earth for added work
(even after those many, many years of work already
performed), we will aid you, we all <i>must</i> aid
those who are working to enlighten the minds, to
awaken the spirits of those immured in the materialism
of Earth. How dense we all are until
awakened! Sorrow smites us, then the fountains of
the Soul come forth; our spiritual Guardians can
help us then, and we begin to know. That was my
case on Earth. Now I realize how little I <i>did</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
know, but I am grateful that I was not an entire
stranger to this realm of spirits, and there is all eternity
in which to grow in knowledge.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Messages from Friends</span></h3>

<p>From those whom I met in their homes of peace
and love and work were many messages to be delivered
<i>in person</i> by me to the dear ones on Earth—messages
that might be of interest here to show that
true affection and personal watchfulness are more
manifested from the spirit side of life than people
know; even those accustomed to spirit communion
and ministration do not realize all that they might
of this nearness.</p>

<p>These messages are too intimate and sacred, however,
to be given here, and they breathe all the fervor
of the <i>real life and love of the Spirit</i>. I shall
communicate them to those to whom they were sent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Spirit-Home of the Children</span></h3>

<p>But O, the Children! the Children! What can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
one write or say? What words adapted to tongue
or pen can convey an adequate idea of the spheres
in which my spirit has often met those darlings of
both worlds? My own baby girl, who passed on
many, many years ago and who has grown to
womanhood in her spirit state, has ever been my
constant companion, as a guardian spirit, during my
busy hours of Earth life, as a <i>pilot</i> and gentle helper
when through sleep or trance-control my spirit was
set free to join her and visit the realm of the children.</p>

<p>These “little ones” are often wiser in knowledge
of the spirit than mortals of more mature years.</p>

<p>Blessings ever attend the presence of a babe in
the home of love on Earth and, in the highest sense,
doubly blessed are those who having possessed such
a treasure know that if the babe passes from mortal
sight the <i>treasure is still theirs</i>, a babe—growing
among the flowers of the gardens of spiritual life
is as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“A light within a light,</div>
<div class="verse">A joy ensphered in joy.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Such a child becomes a sacred guardian unto the
household.</p>

<p>It was indeed an enchanted realm into which we
now entered. Although visited many times during
many years it now seemed more real, more beautiful,
more perfect.</p>

<p>As far as vision (perception) could reach—as
vast as the mind could compass or conceive there
were children, children everywhere! Sporting in
the light of their own brightness and joy; they
were embodied sunbeams, weaving rainbow tinted
thoughts into forms of beauty; flowers, flowers everywhere;
songs of birds and child voices mingling
with murmuring waters amid scenes of rarest beauty.
Ah, the spirit realm of childhood; the playgrounds
of the skies!</p>

<p>Not only children, but “those of larger growth,”
parents, teachers, friends were there to teach, to aid,
<i>and to grow</i> in greater knowledge and usefulness.
Sometimes the children are the teachers to those
older in Earth years.</p>

<p>Isles of light, radiant with flowers and verdure
and surrounded by iridescent waters! Could one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
ever picture the thought-forms of these lovely ones?</p>

<p>“Let us make rainbows,” exclaimed one fairylike
child among a group of playmates, some of whom
were new in that realm. A questioning look came
into the eyes of those addressed: “How can we
<i>make</i> rainbows?” A child-teacher drew near and
said: “I will show you; come with me.”</p>

<p>The five or six eagerly responded.</p>

<p>“Take hold of hands,” the Teacher said, “and
have no fear, there can be no rainbows without
clouds and light.”</p>

<p>I was permitted to follow, with sight or ken, as
the Teacher led them away, away from those enchanting
scenes to where the clouds and shadows
hung dark beneath and around them.</p>

<p>They had drawn near a large city of Earth.</p>

<p>“O let’s not go here,” said one, “it seems so
dark.” But the others urged her on.</p>

<p>Soon one little boy among them said, “See, there
is a little girl. She is cold and is crying on the
street; she is hungry too, let us help her.” They
drew near, and the child, feeling comforted (she
knew not why), sobbed more softly and prayed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“O, my mamma in heaven, <i>can you hear</i> me and
send help to brother and baby—you loved us so?”
Then the spirit children saw a man approaching;
they fairly <i>pushed him toward the weeping child</i>
to whom he spoke kindly asking:</p>

<p>“What is the matter my little girl?”</p>

<p>“O, sir, my mother is dead, and my brother is
sick and the baby has nothing to eat. We’re so
cold in that room.”</p>

<p>“Can you take me there?” asked the man, and
he held out his hand for her to lead him. She
clasped two of his fingers with her tiny hand and
led him through the dark streets to a narrow alley
and up some dark, creaking stairs. Yes, there was
little brother crying for “mamma,” for “sister,” and
the baby asleep but sobbing.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted man saw everything at a
glance.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, my little man. I’ll be back in a few
minutes. Take care of them, little lady, until I
come.”</p>

<p>The spirit children had helped, and helped; they
saw the spirit mother looking very sad, bending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
above the baby, and then above “little brother.”
They also tried to comfort him and help the little
girl. They saw the man go to a telephone and talk
with some one and they could see and feel the light
of kindness with which he spoke and in which the
answers came. How quick he was! He found a
place to buy food. He came back soon, built a
fire, warmed some milk, gave the other children
something to ease the worst pangs of hunger. Presently
a woman came—such a kind heart! She too
worked fast. She gave the baby some food prepared
in the milk, helped the little sick boy, who
was more in need of bodily comfort than anything
else, soothed and fed the little girl who, little mother
that she was, at once aided in caring for the baby.</p>

<p>How the spirit children worked too! They had
made the man see and hear the little girl, had aided
in guiding her to the dismal room called “home”,
had helped him find the telephone and the place to
buy the food, had helped the woman to find the
place, had helped take care of the children and
comfort them and the spirit mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Now,” said the Teacher, “we will return to
our beautiful home.”</p>

<p>One little boy whispered to the Teacher: “I
know there are more children and people who need
help down there. Can we go again and help?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you choose to make rainbows or
flowers or other beautiful things we will go.” And
they rejoiced.</p>

<p>Lo! As they passed through the encompassing
clouds circles of rainbows o’er-spanned them and
paths of rainbows guided them to their spirit-home.
When the other children saw them approaching they
sang, “O, the rainbows! O, the rainbows! When
you dry the tears of sorrow and help those in need
you make rainbows.”</p>

<p>All spirit children are taught to visit the scenes
of Earth life. The home and its loved ones, where
they are missed, ever attracts them and they are
taught to minister, to aid, to guard. If they <i>had</i>
no home on Earth they try to aid those who still
remain in the “orphan” realm of human life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">There are no Orphans in the Spirit
Realm</span>:</h3>

<p>Mothers whose babes are in the Earth life help
to care for those “little waifs” thrust out of human
existence—and for spirit children that pine for
Mother love.</p>

<p>Children whose parents are in Earth life are
taught to aid and comfort those in the home as well
as those who have no home. Especially cared for
are the little “waifs” who were not welcome in the
Earth-forms—even those who have not seen the
light of earthly day—not always from among the
poor of earth were they driven, especially those
abandoned by the unfortunate or misguided mothers.
These and all are “mothered” by the spirits whose
hearts are filled with mother love. And here it is
well to note that not <i>all</i> who are earthly parents
are <i>real</i> fathers and mothers, and many who are
childless—work night and day in the “asylums” on
earth to save some neglected, forsaken, child.
These are real parents.</p>

<p>What greater “punishment” could there be than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
when the human mother has turned away from the
sacred gift of motherhood, she meets, on entering
spirit life, her own neglected babe who welcomes
her there? “Coals of fire!”</p>

<p>It is not always to visit scenes of sorrow and want
that the spirit children are led to the earth: Houses,
schools, playgrounds, “<i>Lyceums</i>,” where the little
ones of earth are taught, places of entertainment and
amusement where they play, and sing, and grow;
there also are the playmates of the spirit-home
mingling with them and endeavoring to impress them
with thoughts and deeds of loving kindness with
things of beauty.</p>

<p>Returning to the Realm of Spirit Children one
finds such respite from care, such constant sources of
happiness, such fashioning of forms of beauty. Oh,
that all could know! Knowledge of all this has
reached but few on Earth; yet more and more will
human minds be pervaded by the methods of the
Skies.</p>

<p>Those who have given new methods of “Education”
to the people of Earth have been inspired
somewhat by these Teachers in spirit states.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Froebel, whose “Kindergarden” system was intended
for “children” of all ages; A. J. Davis,
whose “Progressive Lyceum” system was not intended
<i>exclusively</i> for Sunday training of <i>children</i>
but in its inception was a reproduction of the “teaching”
in spirit states (as far as his mind and inspiration
could reproduce such beautiful methods.)
Even if one could give in human language the form
of teaching (or methods) of the spirit states, the
law of <i>adaptation</i> prevailing in the higher realms
might not always be available in human life.</p>

<p>How beautiful to know that growth—and the
best opportunity for the highest unfoldment with
most loving teachers and Guardians surround the
darlings who have passed from the households of
Earth.</p>

<p>Here then, O human parents, O sisters and
brothers, you who miss the bodily presence of the
one who occupied the “vacant chair,” you who feel
the <i>pervading sense of the absence</i> of the loved
children: here they are; bringing to your very
homes and hearts, could you but realize it, the love,
the knowledge, the wisdom, the beauty of the skies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beauty and Harmony</span></h3>

<p>Ever from childhood through all the years of
Earth life beautiful scenery, tints of earth and sky,
music, in fact all beautiful sights and sounds,
strongly appealed to me. In the spirit states I noted
that harmonious colors, beautiful scenes, and often
exquisite music greeted me as we approached groups
of radiant atmospheres, encircling spheres of light;
such exquisite sounds of harmony as one dreams
must be the “Music of the Spheres.” On approaching
nearer I would perceive that the <i>tints</i> and <i>sounds</i>,
as they reached me, were the radiations of thought,
the spirit <i>activities</i> of these thus ensphered who have
attained real harmony. They were not <span class="allsmcap">MAKING</span>
beautiful colors and music, but <span class="allsmcap">LIVING</span> them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The “Artists”</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps I have elsewhere written that music in
spirit states does not always accompany the one
who was a “musician” on Earth; and harmony of
color, beautiful surroundings may ensphere one who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
never thought of being an “artist.” Their lives
have been interwoven with sweet and loving
thoughts and deeds.</p>

<p>That which would have been a source of surprise
had I not previously known it was that “artists,”
“painters,” “sculptors,” “musicians,” and even some
of the “poets,” known by those names on Earth, are
not fashioning landscapes, portraits, or carving from
stone the images of lovely forms, nor are they fashioning
or weaving into music or verse some classical
or other theme: All of those who were “geniuses,”
all who were Idealists, <i>true lovers of their kind</i>, find
here (in spirit life) their highest happiness in <i>ministering
to others</i>, in moving upon the minds, hearts,
spirits of those to whom they are adapted, until they
perceive the <i>Soul of Beauty</i> and fashion it into their
lives. The “Masters” of art: painters, sculptors,
builders, construct their temples and adorn them
with <i>lives</i>—the true images of beauty in thought,
feeling, aspiration, achievement.</p>

<p>Music is <i>perfect Harmony</i>, of one life with itself
and others, of many lives in all their highest purposes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Such are the creators of the “Symphonies of
the Skies.”</p>

<p>Those who had “Talent,” hoping to achieve the
works of “Genius”—sometime, somewhere, are still
intent on fashioning reproductions or imitations of
natural objects and scenes, or impressing art students
of Earth to produce such effects. But these
are not the creators—“every ‘creation’ is from
within and must <i>live</i>,” said my Teacher.</p>

<p>One wishes for a magic pen, or for a perfect
Gift of Expression, to convey in language the subtle
consciousness of the Beauty and Harmony that meet
one as one is led to the “<i>Atmospheres</i>” of some of
the</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Creators of Beauty.</span>”</h3>

<p>More wonderful than all else was the knowledge
that many who had never painted, carved, builded,
or traced the “score” of musical composition were
surrounded and pervaded by such ineffable loveliness
that one could <i>weep for very joy</i> on perceiving
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Art is Great, but the perception of the Soul of
Beauty is <i>Life! Love!</i>” said the Guide.</p>

<p>One perceives in such states as were there revealed
that the true “artist” has not always been
known among his fellow human beings, moving
upon the world of thought, influencing other lives
by the beauty and harmony of their own natures,
these seem, when viewed from the spirit, to constitute
the real artists.</p>

<p>“Is not the Temple of the Soul a Living Temple,
is not the art of molding the mind to perform
the mandates of the spirit more to be sought for
and greater when attained?” “Eternal in the
Heavens” are the Temples “not made with hands,”
so said the Guide and so I perceived more and
more clearly.</p>

<p>In marked contrast to the foregoing were the
thought-forms surrounding some of those who had
been “artists” on Earth: broken lines, inharmonious
colors, discords, sharp and jagged corners—all
portraying disturbed conditions of the unruly
thoughts and impulses that had possessed them in
Earth life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>I had interesting glimpses of those who were
“<i>working with themselves</i>.” One who was considered
“eminent” in art on Earth was cutting, carving,
breathing upon an <i>image of himself</i>.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> he doing?” I exclaimed, now really
surprised.</p>

<p>“Removing the angularities and errors of his own
nature: jealousy of other artists, the deepest scar;
selfish love of human praise—that overweening desire
for adulation; unwillingness to accord to others
appreciation of their true merits,” replied the Guide.</p>

<p>Later, I saw that artist self-renovated, and one
whom he had envied derided and scorned, when
both were in Earth life, <i>working together</i>, producing,
through artist minds on earth, works that possess
the merits of both with the added <i>tone</i> of harmony;
the strength of one being merged in perfect
accord with the grace and loveliness of the other,
blending in wondrous works of Beauty.</p>

<p>This was a wonderful lesson, serving to illustrate
that at first, and possibly for some time after entering
spirit life one’s chief occupation is—or should
be—removing one’s own limitations; but this cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
<i>begin</i> until one is aware that one <i>has</i> the imperfections;
to be conscious of one’s faults is half
the remedy.</p>

<p>Bodily imperfections, infirmities and disease, unless
retained psychologically by having constantly
encroached upon the mind, or deformities that are
dwelt upon mentally, are dropped with the body;
but such <i>infirmities of mind</i> as are born of an undue
“egotism,” undue <i>self love</i>, (the capital “I” around
which the universe revolves), must be removed before
the spirit can enter upon <i>real work</i>. As with
artists so with those eminent in science or any department
of human thought and endeavor; the truly
Great are ever the most humble; realizing that however
much they know, and however clearly they
can <i>think</i> “the universe is full of things we do not
know”; as one of the great ones aptly said.</p>

<p>I had met one—a brilliant mind—who in Earth
life was gifted in many ways, chiefly mathematics.
He had breakfasted on billions, dined on duodecillions,
supped on sepdecillions, he wrote to the rythm
of “logarithms,” and worshiped at the shrine of the
calculus! I tried to imagine what he might be doing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Perhaps he was measuring the immeasurable
or calculating the uncalculable! I saw him!
Where was his Observatory? Where his maps,
charts, instruments? The answer swept over and
through me with a great thrill.</p>

<p>The knowledge that comes to the spirit is instantaneous—if
one is ready—how can one use
even the most perfect instrumentalities and methods
when time and space are eliminated? <i>Truth is perceived</i>:
in homely phrase “No ladder for the air
men,” “no mathematics for the soul!” I never could
have imagined how quickly he would “perceive.”
He had attained the real knowledge of wisdom and
love.</p>

<p>The poet-prophets of the world, those who have
sung in immortal verse the Truths of the Skies:
Truths of Freedom, Justice, Love, Spiritual Exaltation,
moved by the <i>theme</i> of their songs, using
their art as a setting to the Jewel of Truth, these
endowed ones knew that without the inspiring
<i>theme</i>, the words, the rythm would be empty bubbles,
glittering nothings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">All Are Teachers</span></h3>

<p>All exalted lives (spiritually) moving and living
in similar planes of thought—born of their spiritual
states—are attracted to each other in spirit life for
the interchange of perceptions of Truth and bearing
forward the work of illuminating such minds on
Earth <i>as are ready</i> to receive along the lines of
human progress and unfoldment, imparting “the
things they are ready to know.”</p>

<p>Spirits, the wise ones, do not make the mistake,
as many do in human life, of trying to <i>force</i> upon
the minds of those whom they teach the truths or
knowledge for which those minds are not prepared:
“Arithmetic first, after that geometry and higher
mathematics,” is the rule in Earth schools. So in
the instruction by spirit Teachers there is <i>adaptation</i>
to the pupil not only of the Teacher but of that
which is to be taught. There are “ministering spirits”
adapted to every condition.</p>

<p>I could but marvel at the wonderful workings of
these principles that govern the influence of “mind
upon mind”—really <i>spirit upon spirit</i>; so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
more complex yet more potent than the “forces”
and operation of the “laws” of the material universe—“laws”
so little understood, “forces” so dimly
perceived.</p>

<p>“Most of the people on the Earth-plane know so
little even concerning the things and forces most
intimately connected with their bodily existence:
the sunshine, the air they breathe, the earth beneath
them, the sea, and the heavens of <i>Stars</i>; we must
not wonder over-much that they know little or nothing
of this inner, though more real, realm of Spirit.”</p>

<p>This was from the Guide. Anticipating the
question that was welling up from the mind: “Why
do not those on Earth know more of these spirit
states, more of their own conditions spiritually?”
The answer had already been given, and as we
passed on the Teacher said:</p>

<p>“Growth, unfoldment, waiting, working.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Co-Workers</span></h3>

<p>Among the groups and assemblages whom I met
and with whom I was most frequently in communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
during this surpassing sojourn were the arisen
co-workers in the “<i>Movement</i>” with which my life-work
has been most identified:</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Spiritualism</span>”</h3>

<p>In the work of a life-time as a chosen “instrument”
to bear “glad tidings,” to promote the knowledge
of spirit existence here and beyond the change
called death, and the ministration from and communion
with the arisen ones, I had met in outward
existence every leading mind and every worker
(medium) known in the Spiritualistic movement.</p>

<p>We were always friends, always co-workers, sisters
and brothers bearing forward a great Truth.
Very frequently during this wonderful visit in the
realm of spirit I saw them—either alone or in
smaller or larger groups, renewing the companionship
that had been so beautiful and delightful when
we had worked side by side in human forms.</p>

<p>In your memory, dear reader, or in your reading
scan the list of names who were first known as “Investigators”
then as “Spiritualists,” and the names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of those known as <span class="allsmcap">MEDIUMS</span> (there were no “Psychics”
in those days.) I knew and loved them all.
I met them all. Each one in spirit life is still engaged
in imparting this knowledge—most important
of all that human beings can receive—concerning
Spiritual Truth. Existence, life, love, work
beyond the change called death;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spiritualism as a Movement</span>,</h3>

<p>I had ever been instructed by my Guides, was
given to the world when <i>needed</i>, and when there
were those upon the Earth who were ready, when
the “ages were ripe” for its coming.</p>

<p>In spirit states of Earth and in the realms far beyond
were those who knew the “day and hour” had
come for “moving upon the minds of Earth with
this new illumination.”</p>

<p>There was from the “smallest” to the “greatest,”
from the seemingly “least” to the “most important”
of the manifestations a concerted action. The
“rappings” at Hydesville were no “accident,” the
visions of Clairvoyant and seer, the writings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
trance utterances (phenomenal) were all a part of
this <i>Stupendous Movement</i>. All, all, under guidance
of those wise Spirits who knew what the
people of the world needed and gave it to them
according to their needs.</p>

<p>Necessarily many extremists and “imitators”
would be attracted to the subject—like driftwood
following or borne upon every new current of
thought—but it is safe to say that Spiritualism during
the sixty-seven years since the “Rochester
Knockings” has attracted the attention of more eminent
minds in every department of human research
(and convinced them too) and given knowledge
and consolation to a greater number of people than
any movement or system of knowledge in ancient
or modern times. With those who are willing and
anxious to be classed as Spiritualists it is <i>knowledge</i>
of life beyond death—and of the presence and
ministration of the beloved arisen ones.</p>

<p>So spoke my Guide to me and to the group of
co-workers who had come forward to meet and
greet me. How young and beautiful they were.
Always I had noted in earth life how beautiful the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
dear ones are when one has been for a time absent
from them—and here, in this realm of perpetual
youth, with the freedom from human pain and cares
that some of them had so bravely borne, I could but
note the beauty that is theirs.</p>

<p>In the interchange of thought and experiences
with these arisen co-workers I could readily understand
that being brought into direct personal relationship
with their “Guides,” “Inspirers,” “Teachers,”
“helpers” and with each other, they had become
more and more aware of the true meaning and
nature of the gifts (mediumship) that were theirs
when in the form, and they realized that even those
“Inspirers” and “Teachers” were also the instruments
of higher and wiser Spirits.</p>

<p>One sister worker said to me “I always wanted
to <i>see</i> my Guides, as you did, but I could not, for
the gift of spirit vision was not mine. Now I understand
what it means to ‘see with the eyes of the
Spirit’ and I am satisfied.”</p>

<p>Those who had been my most intimate co-workers
had many things to tell me of their “awakening”
into added perception of spiritual things and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
work assigned them in their new state of existence;
still ministering, still trying to lift the veil, mostly of
ignorance, that divides mortals from their arisen
ones. Many were the loving messages sent to
friends and loved <i>Companions</i> still in Earth life.</p>

<p>“Tell them you <i>saw</i> me <i>here</i> in spirit life, and I
am ever near them, in response to a thought, or wish
or especially a <i>need</i>, guiding, guarding, aiding.”</p>

<p>It seems better to receive a message from one
who has “been there,” who has actually <i>seen</i> and
<i>conversed</i> with one’s friends “face to face” and
“spirit to spirit.” So, in the treasure house of my
spirit are stored those messages to be given whenever
I meet any of those loved ones in human life
to whom I was so fortunate as to bear a message.
It is to them alone that the message for them can
be given.</p>

<p>The transcendent brightness and spiritual beauty
of that assemblage of spirits—from guardian spirits
of relatives and friends to the wisest and most advanced
that one could see, are beyond my power
of language to express.</p>

<p>There is no formal taking of one’s “place” or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
“position,” no ceremonious “assigning” of “duty”
or “work,” but in groups and larger companies, as
well as in personal ministrations, a mutual understanding
of purpose, according to adaptation. If
a united or concerted action upon earth-minds
for any given purpose is needed it is readily perceived
and entered upon by all who are in accord,
and is performed by such methods as enlightened
spirits readily understand.</p>

<p>Human minds are better prepared to comprehend
the methods of spirit communicating with spirit
since “wireless telegraphy” and other recent scientific
wonders have been achieved, not that the <i>process</i>
is similar in any degree, but being prepared for
the new revealments in science also prepares impartial
minds to know of the more subtle powers of the
spirit. “Volition” in its highest analysis is the one
attribute of the spirit by which other spirits know—through
perception, what is being imparted, <i>but</i>
there must ever be <i>accord</i>, <i>sympathy</i>, <i>adaptation</i>.</p>

<p>From some of those who had been my friends in
my early life and who were “leading minds” in this
cause, and in other subjects of human interest, I received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
many thoughts and suggestions concerning
the present status of the “movement” (Spiritualism)
and what they now think of the possible and desirable
results of “united action,”—“organization”
for the work and the workers. These and many
other themes must be left for opportunity, time and
strength to reveal, as my work goes on in human
life.</p>

<p>One notes the same minds and spirits in many
assemblages of the different branches of all purposes
for aiding humanity. Even as when on earth
the “Pioneers” in “Anti-slavery,” “Equal Suffrage,”
“Temperance,” were the same staunch
body of men and women, ready now as then to respond
to the call to give a voice to Truth. In the
assemblies for promoting “peace” by “those who
love their fellow men,” there was the universal sentiment:
“Peace must be born of Justice and Justice
can only come by true Fraternity.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“My country is the world;</div>
<div class="verse">My countrymen all mankind.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This is the standard extending to include “All
Souls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“It seems to inhere in the very nature of <i>human
life</i> that men will <i>fight</i> for: (1) Personal liberty:
freedom from physical bondage and involuntary
servitude; (2) For defence of those nearest and
dearest enshrined in the ‘home’; (3) For country
when it represents the ‘home’ and those ‘Ideals’
to which the heart ever clings.”</p>

<p>To “remove the <i>Causes</i> of War” all selfish seeking,
all aggression by any nation upon the rights of
others must cease, “and this must come by growth,
by enlightenment in the cardinal principles of justice,
love and truth.” These and many other
thoughts were given forth in that assembly.</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>A great wave of uprising among the <i>women</i> of
all nations was predicted in favor of conditions that
would “make for peace” leading to united efforts
between the most enlightened men and women of
all nations to the establishment of “Peace born of
Right—Not Might.” The Peace foretold by
poets and sages of all time. Yet all agree in that
wonderful assemblage, that “treaties of Peace” are
without avail unless the moral force of the nations—among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
their leaders, rulers and a majority of
their people—is sufficient to dominate; and make
just treaties <i>binding</i>.</p>

<p>As individuals are now expected to adjust their
difference in Courts of Law (often misnamed justice),
and it is the aim of a majority of citizens not
to encroach upon the real rights of others, so the
time <i>must</i> come when nations will agree to a similar
method in adjusting possible differences that may
arise; and this much <i>can</i> come even before the real
millenium of “Peace on Earth and Love to all
Mankind.” There must be some other International
Tribunal than the battlefield! Earth, sea,
and air, <i>must</i> not be held in bondage for physical
carnage!</p>

<p>In the final “Day of Peace” even Peace Tribunals
will not be needed, but now—“may Angels
speed the Day of Peace born of Justice.”</p>

<p>In most instances I could tell the personality, or
human name, of each one giving forth a particular
thought, and all were in accord. Alas, I could also
perceive that they saw, in viewing the conditions of
Earth that “the end is not yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>I cannot mar this wonderful visit—this respite
from pain and cares of Earth by dwelling too long
among the shadows, warclouds and darkened states
of Earth life. As beyond the storm clouds of
Earth’s nearest material atmosphere the sun always
shines glorious and with resplendent brightness, so
beyond the horrors of war the desolation and ravagement
of nations incident thereto, beyond the
storms, earthquakes, and cataclysmic throes of nature,
the Sun of Spiritual Hope and Love ever
shines surpassing fair, and all the Angelic and
Spiritual Hosts are ready to aid, strengthen, succor
the spirits enshrouded in time and earth conditions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Return</span></h3>

<p>More and more frequent were the summons and
the visits to my mortal body, to reimbue, as it was
now found possible, with my spirit, to restore with
the personal presence, the body within which the
vital spark had been kept alive by blessed Guardian
Spirits and devoted friends on Earth.</p>

<p>More and more the spirit “Home friends,” the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Best Beloved, and the Guides encouraged the
thought of my return to fulfill the appointed work
on Earth. I had prayed to be allowed to remain,
to let the body pass; but now, gradually it is true,
the idea of resuming the human habiliments, the
garb of the material body, became less repugnant,
and I finally freely said: “Yes, I will go as that is
the appointed way.”</p>

<p>Have you, dear friend, who may be reading
these imperfect fragments of a <i>perfect experience</i>,
(as any narrative must be) ever visited some fair
garden, some sequestered home of dearest friends,
a place radiant with beauty and enchantment;
where there were flowers massed in rarest combinations
of color and fragrance, fountains murmuring
in answer to the summer winds, music, such as
seemed a part of the enrapturing scene; have you
enjoyed this with the chosen friends that alone
could make the scene sacred, the Best Beloved?
And have you known the reluctance to return to
the “outer world” of daily routine of care, perhaps
of pain? Ah, then you know in the <i>smallest degree</i>
what it meant to me to return to my bodily form!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Yet even now the soul of all that was mine in
that wonderful, surpassing state is ever with me;
nor will it again be absent from me—since it is enfolded
in my very being. I am more complete now,
even in the body which ever divides us from the
Soul of Life.</p>

<p>“You will be with us again and often,” they
said; the Guide said no formal “farewells,” no
“leavetaking,” but everywhere from every Dear
and Blessed one “Blessings, Peace, Joy, and Love
go with you into added Strength and Work.”</p>

<p>And here I am: ready to help the body to grow
stronger, and to <i>willingly, joyfully</i>, in the future as
in the past, perform the work assigned me—<i>until—they—call—me—Home</i>.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cora L. V. Richmond.</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">An Added Word or Two</h2>
</div>

<p>The possibility of the spirit “leaving the body”
for a time and then returning and resuming its usual
activities has been demonstrated many times. In
some instances the temporary separation was caused
by accident, illness, states of coma induced by anesthetics,
trance, either of spirit control or hypnosis,
and sometimes a <i>voluntary absence</i> or activity not
suspending the vital functions of the body. It is
also undoubtedly true that during sleep—especially
that restful, dreamless sleep that betokens a normal
state of mind and body, the spirit avails itself of
the opportunity of restoration by spiritual methods
and activities not possible while urging the body to
do its bidding. Not only Spiritualists, Psychologists
and Psychic Research students have well
authenticated cases of the undoubted activity of the
Spirit apart from the body, but many prominent
physicians have recorded their experiences with patients
whose bodily functions were suspended, even
to seeming dissolution, and upon the unexpected resuscitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of the subject there would be a vivid
account of active experiences in spirit—usually
pleasant scenes and meetings with friends long
passed into spirit life. These visits to “heaven”
would be sometimes tinged with the religious bias
of the subject, but this is not strange in view of the
fact that <i>spirit states are conditions of the mind</i> and
spirit experiencing them.</p>

<p>Among the most familiar popular illustrations are
those narrated by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, especially
by “Gail Hamilton” who, being thought
“dead” returned to her body, narrated to her
pastor the experiences she had during that period of
suspended animation and resumed her pen, remaining
in mortal life a considerable time thereafter.</p>

<p>Although not usual, this class of experiences is
not so <i>unusual</i> as many imagine or assert. And
the writer having been from childhood accustomed
to the “other state” (“Inner,” “higher”), of consciousness
can distinctly trace her experiences in
that inner realm as forming fully a third if not one-half
of her life-experiences.</p>

<p>The “realm of spirit” in which she has so often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
found herself a participant is, therefore, no unfamiliar
realm; in fact if called upon to decide <i>which
state</i> is the <i>reality—the life</i>, she would unhesitatingly
say: the <i>inner</i> state, the <i>super-mundane</i> realm.</p>

<p>Of the many eminent men of Science in both
Europe and America who have come to a knowledge
of the truths of Spirit existence, continuance of
life after transition,—and the writer has known
them all personally, except the one she is about to
mention,—probably Sir Oliver Lodge has approached
the subject of “psychic Research” (Spiritualism)
with a mind the <i>best prepared</i> to receive
(perceive) Spiritual Truth. I say this with the utmost
reverence and admiration for the long list of
names—eminent alike in their personal qualities
and scientific attainments, whose lives have been
made brighter by a knowledge of demonstrated future
existence and a belief in the Immortality of the
Soul. Shall I name some of them? Hare, Mapes,
Denton, Wallace, Crookes, Varley, Zollner, Flammarion—the
list is almost endless.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver Lodge has not only recently, and very
publicly, announced his full belief (knowledge) of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
continued personal existence beyond the change
called death, but the possibility of communion with
those “gone before” and the certainty that he had
personal evidence beyond cavil or doubt, proofs indubitable,
of the presence of and communication
with his particular friends, <i>but</i>—and this is the point
I wish to emphasize—in his earlier utterances on this
subject he said in effect: “When I become aware
that the human spirit while still animating the body,
or not released by death, has <i>such surpassing powers</i>,
‘telepathy,’ ‘voluntary action’ <i>apart from the
body</i>, showing conclusively that the activities of the
mind <i>are not</i> dependent upon the physical organism—I
concluded there <i>must</i> be evidence to show that
the spirit <i>can</i> and does survive the body.” This
and much more was in his published statements concerning
his investigations in connection with Psychic
Research—showing that he approached the
subject not only from the “effect to cause” line of
usual scientific investigation, but had already in his
quickened perception the vivification of a-priori
knowledge leading from “<i>cause to effect</i>.”</p>

<p>One would like to accumulate and set down in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
condensed manner all the available evidences of
“absence from the body”—of which the writer has
a large and increasing store, but this writing is more
distinctly in the form of a message for this particular
time.</p>

<p>With our own “other world” within and about
us, moving “like wings of light on dark and stormy
air,” with such unused, wonderful powers, what
wonder that one having partaken of the bounties of
that inner realm longs to awaken the “sleeping”
spirits of those in human life—or, more correctly
speaking, tear aside the veil and show how wonderful
are the dormant powers within each person:
Soul-powers more active, perhaps, than any are
aware! Who can tell, until the film of mental
blindness is removed, how great may be the works
accomplished by the spirit when the body sleeps,
when one is “absent minded,” or when <i>thinking intently</i>
of a particular friend, one finds at that very
day and hour the friend had “passed away”?</p>

<p>It is of the “Substance that dreams are made”
that we shall ultimately find our divinest realities,
<i>our very lives</i> are fashioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>This narrative of “experiences while out of my
body” is only a prelude to those vaster heights,
those more inner scenes, that I hope sometime to be
able to record: The Symphony is Life itself whose
theme of Love is Endless, Endless, Endless.</p>
